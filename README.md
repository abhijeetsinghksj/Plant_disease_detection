# Plant_disease_detection
Methodology We started with a deep neural network for the classification of healthy and diseased plants. We have built an n-layered neural network We trained our 2-layered neural network model with a kaggle tomato plant disease dataset which consists of 10classes.CNN CNN uses special convolution and pooling processes and performs parameter sharing.
